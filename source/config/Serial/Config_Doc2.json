{"title": "Device Selection", "icon":"account_tree", "text": "Since this measurement system contains programmable Source and Drain channels, the software must communicate which pins to connect the Source and Drain to in each Experiment. This is done using the \"Source\" and \"Drain\" fields specified in the \"Identifiers\" section of the Experiment Runner or Schedule Builder. You can check which device is being selected by toggling to the \"System\" view in the \"Preview\" panel that is available for most types of Experiments in the Experiment Runner."}
