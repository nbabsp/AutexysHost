{"title": "Device Selection", "icon":"account_tree", "text": "Since this measurement system contains programmable Source and Drain channels, the software must communicate which pins to connect the Source and Drain to in each Experiment. This is done using the \"Device\" name specified in the \"Identifiers\" section of the Experiment Runner or Schedule Builder. By default, the measurement system will look for Devices to be named following the \"(source)-(drain)\" format. For example, entering a Device name of \"1-2\" in the Experiment Runner will connect pin \"1\" to the Source and pin \"2\" to the Drain throughout that Experiment. Similarly: \"3-4\" would programmatically select pins 3 & 4, \"40-30\" would select pins 40 & 30, and so on. \n\nIf you prefer not to use these numerical names to identify your devices, there are some tools below on this page that allow you to add \"nicknames\" for your devices so that you can rename devices, such as renaming \"1-2\" to \"My Favorite Device\", for example. Then any time you specify \"My Favorite Device\" in the Experiment Runner, this measurement system will know it should connect pin 1 to the Source and pin 2 to the Drain."}
