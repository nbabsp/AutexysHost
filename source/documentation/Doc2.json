{"title": "Experiment Runner", "text": "The Experiment Runner is the part of the software used to collect and save data. When the Experiment Runner opens, the user is prompted to select the type of experiment from a dropdown menu. This dropdown menu contains a variety of standard procedures as well one option (\"Schedule File\") that allows the user to choose one of their own custom-designed experiments (see next section on Schedule Builder for more information). Once the user has chosen their experiment type, they have the opportunity to set several options for each experiment type, as well as specify where data for the experiment should be saved by setting the Identifiers. When all the options have been finalized (and the appropriate measurement system has been connected to the software), the experiment can be launched and a progress window will appear to display progress updates while the experiment is running. Additionally, most experiments will display a plot that updates live as the data is being recorded. If at any point the experiment needs to be aborted, there is a \"stop\" button located by the launch button that will stop after any currently collected data finishes saving (if you cannot wait for the experiment to reach a safe stopping point, your other option would be to completely restart the software, although this is not recommended). When all of the progress bars are filled and the window turns green, the experiment is complete. As soon as an experiment is finished the system is ready to run another one, or if all experiments are complete then the data can be viewed and exported from the Browser."}
