{"title": "Controlling Sampling Methodology", "text": "With many procedures, there are parameters that allow users to adjust how quickly and exactly how devices are sampled. The \"Delay Between Measurements\" parameter is the default way to do this. It adds the given amount of time between each sample to the best of the measurement system's ability. However, at high sampling rates, this parameter may not produce accurate results since the measurements themselves take up some time. If accuracy at these rates are desired, the user should enable the \"Fast Sweep\" toggle and set the sampling frequency at \"Fast Sweep Speed.\""}
