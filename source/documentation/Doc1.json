{"title": "Overview", "text": "The Autexys software can be broken down into 3 main features: the Experiment Runner, the Schedule Builder, and the Browser. The Experiment Runner is the hub for collecting data from experiments. After running some of the standard pre-made experiments, the Schedule Builder is the place to go to create your own experiments and save them for future use. Finally, while the Experiment Runner displays live results as they are being saved, the Browser provides a sorted view of all past results and the ability to export those results for more detailed analysis."}
