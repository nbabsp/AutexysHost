{"title": "Channel Setup", "icon":"looks_3", "text": "The measurement system that has been connected contains dual channels that are capable of applying voltages and measuring currents (Channel 1 is known as the \"Drain\" channel and Channel 2 is known as the \"Gate\"). The Drain and Gate channels apply their voltages relative to a third reference channel (this Channel is known as the \"Source\"). Therefore the system is really able to apply a \"Drain-to-Source\" voltage and a \"Gate-to-Source\" voltage, but for simplicity these are referred to throughout the software as simply the \"Drain Voltage\" and \"Gate Voltage.\" Similarly, the currents in these channels are referred throughout the software as simply the \"Drain Current\" and \"Gate Current.\" "}
