{"title": "Programmable Channels", "icon":"power_input", "text": "Although this measurement system has static \"Drain,\" \"Gate,\" and \"Source\" outputs that can be manually wired up to a device-under-test, it also contains a 68-pin PLCC socket that the signals can be routed to. Of the 68 pins, one of them is reserved for system ground, which is provided primarily for grounding on-chip features for RF noise shielding purposes (note that the Gate and Drain voltages are referenced to the Source channel rather than to system ground, so it would not generally be appropriate to connect system ground directly to the device-under-test). Three more of the 68 pins are directly connected to the Gate channel. These Gate pins are provided in multiple locations on the socket for convenience, but note that they are all electrically connected and equivalent. \n\nThe remaining 64 pins are number 1-to-64, and these pins can by dynamically connected to either the Source or the Drain channels. The ability to route the Source and Drain channels enables completely programmable device selection since the \"Gate-to-Source\" and \"Drain-to-Source\" voltages will only be applied to the device that is currently connected to the Source and Drain."}
