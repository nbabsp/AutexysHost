{"text": "The Schedule Builder is a file editor that allows users to set up a list of multiple procedures to run back-to-back in the Experiment Runner. The Schedule Builder creates \"schedule files,\" which are one of the options to load into the Experiment Runner. When the Schedule Builder is first opened, the user is provided with a new blank schedule file that contains 1 single empty job. The user can expand the job to choose its procedure type, set important parameters, and enter the Identifiers that determine where this job will save data. Once the user is done editing the first job in the schedule file, they can minimize it and add more jobs to the schedule file, or they can just leave it with only 1 job. If you make a mistake or want to start over on a new blank file at any time, just click the refresh button in the top right corner.\n\nWhen the user is satisfied with the finished schedule file, they can scroll down to save it. New schedule files should be given a unique name to avoid overwriting an old schedule file, but schedule files are saved separately for each user, so you can easily share files and not worry about accidentally overwriting each other. Schedule files can also be split up between different projects, or you can keep all of them in the same project if you prefer. \n\nLater, if you would like to re-load a schedule file to make changes, that can be done using the load button in the top right hand corner. Just remember to save the schedule file again when you are done making changes.", "title": "Schedule Builder", "edit_mode": false, "readonly": true}
