{"title": "Introduction", "text": "The Autexys (Automated Experimentation System) is a Python-based graphical user interface that provides a user-friendly way to control systems that capture measurements on fabricated devices. Autexys provides user-customizable experiments to run on devices and a wide range of ways to visualize the resulting data. Autexys can also automate testing through queueing up a \"schedule\" of experiments, reducing the amount of time users spend monitoring one experiment. The workflow consists of (1) this user interface software, (2) the modular hardware source-measure units (SMUs) comprising the physical measurement systems, and (3) the chips that the user fabricates with devices to be tested. Typically, the process starts with the fabrication of a device set (or chip) that adheres to the design rules for an intended SMU. After fabrication, the chip is often fitted into a ceramic package and the metal device pads are wire bonded from the chip to the package. This allows the chip to be socketed into a measurement system for testing. Finally, this User Interface software is used to run experiments and log data. The following sections will describe the components this software in detail to help users get the most out of their workflow.", "readonly":true}
