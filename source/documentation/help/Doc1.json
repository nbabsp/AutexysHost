{"title": "Dashboard", "text": "The landing page for the Autexys software is the Dashboard. The Dashboard contains a summary of \"recent activity,\" which are the newest devices that have been measured with the system. In addition, the Dashboard contains a quick link to each of the 3 core features of the Autexys software: the Experiment Runner, the Schedule Builder, and the Browser. The Experiment Runner is the hub for collecting data from experiments. After you finish running some of the standard pre-made experiments, the Schedule Builder is the place to go to create your own experiments and save them for future use. Finally, while the Experiment Runner displays live results as they are being saved, the Browser provides a sorted view of all past results and the ability to export those results for more detailed analysis. Each of these core features will be described in more detail in the sections below.", "readonly":true}
