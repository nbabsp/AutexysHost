{"title": "Introduction", "text": "The Autexys (Automated Experimentation System Host) User Interface is a web application with a clean, modern look and feel that controls systems that take measurements on fabricated devices. Compared to similar systems used previously in our lab, Autexys provides a much wider range of experiments to run on devices and a wider range of ways to visualize the resulting data. Autexys also automates testing, reducing the amount of time users spend manually iterating through devices. The system consists of 1) the User Interface software, 2) several source measurement units (SMUs) and printed circuit boards (PCBs) comprising the physical measurement systems, and 3) the chips that the user makes with devices to be tested. Typically, the workflow begins with fabricating a set of devices on a single chip (silicon wafer) - in many configurations, this must conform to a particular design. We have been using the KLayout for chip design, though other applications can be used. After fabrication, the chip is often fitted into a plastic package and the metal device pads are wire bonded from the chip to the package. This allows the chip to be fitted into a PCB. Finally, the measurement systems are configured, and User Interface software is used to run experiments. The following sections will describe each possible hardware configuration and the unique workflow for each."}
