{"title": "Benchtop", "text": "In addition to the previous three core features, there is a fourth core feature that is complementary but separate from the other three, and that is the Benchtop. The purpose of the Benchtop is to quickly connect to a measurement system and see a real-time display of its current readings. In this mode, the measurement system acts like a more typical piece of benchtop laboratory equipment, with knobs to adjust the voltages and a plot that shows the last 30 seconds of current measurements.", "readonly":true}
