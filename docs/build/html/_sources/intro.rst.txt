Autexys Documentation
=====================

Welcome to Autexys, the Automated Experimentation System!

Still working on figuring out how to create this documentation.  Preferably, it would be fully automated from docstrings in the code.  The lastest command attempted is

sphinx-apidoc --implicit-namespaces -d 20 -o source/ ../source/

Executed from the /docs/ folder.  The implicit-namespaces flag seems to make it recurse as it should without __init__.py files, but this flag also causes everything to be marked as inside of a source package, which is not the case.  After running the above, documentation is generated by running

make html

From the same directory.
